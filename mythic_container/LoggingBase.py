        Active (bool): Indicating if this callback is in the active callbacks table or not
        IntegrityLevel (int): The integrity level for the callback that mirrors that of Windows (0-4) with a value of 3+ indicating a High Integrity (or root) callback
        Locked (bool): Indicating if this callback is locked or not so that other operators can't task it
        OperationID (int): The ID of the operation this callback belongs to
        CryptoType (str): The type of cryptography used for this callback (typically None or aes256_hmac)

        Domain (str): The domain associated with the callback if there is one
        ExtraInfo (str): Freeform field of extra data that can be stored and retrieved with a callback
        SleepInfo (str): Freeform sleep information that can be stored and retrieved as part of a callback (this isn't pre-populated, the agent or command files must set it)
